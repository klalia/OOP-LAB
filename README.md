# OOP-LAB

This is a zoo model, using OOP (object orientated programming). It models a zoo that has animals, staff members and the ticket prices.

OOP is based around objects rather than actions and data rather than logic. It consists of 4 pillars including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and abstraction.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is where there is a super classes and a sub classes. The sub class inherits methods and fields from the parent class and can also include method and fields of there own. A benefit of inheritance is that it prevents DRY (repeated code).

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. For example overriding is a method of polymorphism. This is by overring the previous method by writing the same class name with the new method.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of combining both functions and data in a single unit, for example a class. In encapsulation the data is not accessed directly, it is accessed through the functions present inside the class. The attributes inside the class are kept private and public methods are provided to manipulate the attributes.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is hiding the complexity of the code and just portraying the code relevant to the user. For example with a phone, a user only wants to use the home button which is shown to them and expects it to take them to the home screen, how this process is carried out is hidden through the use of abstraction.
